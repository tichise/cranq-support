    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cranq ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Cranq accesses the following data solely for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health & Fitness Data:</strong> The App reads your workout and activity data from Apple HealthKit (cycling, running, and other activities) to display statistics and visualizations. This data is never transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The App accesses workout route data stored in HealthKit to display activity maps. Location data is processed locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> The App fetches historical weather information from the Open-Meteo API based on your activity dates and locations. No personally identifiable information is sent with these requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. AI Coach Feature (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the AI Coach feature, you must provide your own API key for OpenAI or Anthropic. When using this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your activity summary data may be sent to the selected AI provider to generate coaching advice.</li>
        <li>Your API key is stored locally on your device and is never shared with us.</li>
        <li>Please review the privacy policies of <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI</a> or <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">Anthropic</a> for information on how they handle data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All health and fitness data remains on your device through Apple HealthKit. The App does not have its own server or database. User preferences are stored locally using UserDefaults.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your personal data to third parties, except as described in Section 2 (AI Coach) when you explicitly choose to use that feature.</p>

    <h2>5. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App may use analytics services to improve the user experience. If analytics are enabled, data collected is anonymized and used solely for app improvement purposes. The App does not track users across other apps or websites for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via <a href="https://github.com/tichise/cranq-support/issues">GitHub Issues</a>.</p>
