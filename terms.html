    <p>By downloading or using Cranq ("the App"), you agree to the following terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>Cranq is an activity management app that visualizes cycling, running, and other fitness records from Apple HealthKit. The App is provided for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>2. HealthKit Data</h2>
    <p>The App requires access to Apple HealthKit to function. You are responsible for granting appropriate permissions. You can edit or delete your own data at any time through the App or Apple Health.</p>

    <h2>3. AI Coach Feature</h2>
    <p>The AI Coach feature is optional and requires your own API key from a supported provider (OpenAI or Anthropic). You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any costs incurred from API usage with your key.</li>
        <li>Complying with the terms of service of the AI provider you use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI-generated coaching advice is for informational purposes only and should not be considered professional medical or fitness advice.</p>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any data displayed in the App, including health statistics, weather data, or AI-generated content.</p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, design, and code in the App are the property of the developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with third-party services including Apple HealthKit, Open-Meteo, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
